/*
 -> If a function is to use arguments, it must declare variables that accept the values of the arguments.
 These variables are called the formal parameters of the function.

 -> While calling a function there are 3 ways you can pass parameters: Call by value, call by pointer, call by reference.

 -> The call by value method of passing arguments to a function copies the actual value of an argument into the formal parameter of the function.
Changes made to the parameter inside the function have no effect on the argument.

 -> The call by pointer method of passing arguments to a function copies the address of an argument into the formal parameter.
 This means that changes made to the parameter affect the passed argument.

 -> The call by reference method of passing arguments to a function copies the reference of an argument into the formal parameter.
 Changes made to the parameter affect the passed argument. References are generally implemented using pointers. A reference is same object,
 just with a different name and reference must refer to an object. Since references canâ€™t be NULL, they are safer to use.
